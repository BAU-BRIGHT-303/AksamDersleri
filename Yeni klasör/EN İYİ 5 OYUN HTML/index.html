        God of War Ragnarök is an action-adventure game developed by Santa
        Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was
        released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and
        PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the God of War
        series. It is the ninth installment in the series, the ninth
        chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on
        Norse mythology, the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features
        series protagonist Kratos and his teenage son Atreus. Concluding the
        Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnarök, the eschatological
        event which is central to Norse mythology and was foretold to happen in
        the previous game after Kratos killed the Aesir god Baldur.

        The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by
        Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the
        PlayStation 4. Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), the game
        focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States
        whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out in revenge for a murder, and
        Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia
        and a religious cult. The game uses a third-person perspective; the
        player must fight human enemies and cannibalistic zombie-like creatures
        with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.
