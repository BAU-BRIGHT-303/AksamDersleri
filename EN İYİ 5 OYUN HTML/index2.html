        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[b] is a 2015 action role-playing game developed
        and published by CD Projekt. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The
        Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third game in The Witcher video
        game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective.
        The games follow the The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by
        Andrzej Sapkowski. <br /><br />The game takes place in a fictional
        fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt of
        Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his
        adopted daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt.
        Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact
        with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience
        points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and
        purchase equipment. The game's story has three possible endings,
        determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative.

        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
        North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in
        the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and
        the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San
        Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows
        three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster
        Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their
        attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government
        agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely
        roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos,
        based on Los Angeles.
